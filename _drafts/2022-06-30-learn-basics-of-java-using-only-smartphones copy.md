## Inclusion and inequality

Yes, education should include everyone. Of course, often, this is not possible due to limited access to resources based on low income or uneven distribution of wealth. The Key Indicators of Households Social Consumption on Education in India of the National Sample Survey ([NSS 75th round page 47](http://164.100.161.63/sites/default/files/publication_reports/KI_Education_75th_Final.pdf)) showed that in rural areas 4.4% and in urban areas 23.4% of the households are having a computer at home. The [Telecom Statistics of India 2019](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Telecom%20Statistics%20India-2019.pdf) on the other hand showed that the teledensity (telephones per 100 inhabitants) in rural areas is 57.50 and in urban areas is 159.66. [Deloitte's prediction for India are](https://www2.deloitte.com/in/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/big-bets-on-smartphones-semiconductors-and-streaming-service.html) that the smartphone users will increase in the coming years.

 So why not utilize smartphones for a software engineering course to include as many interested students as possible. Also those students, who do not have access to a computer or laptop for their studies.

 ## Resources and apps
 
 In this post, I want to create a structure for a software engineering course that teaches basics of Java programming with a strong focus that everything is be solveable/doable using only smartphones. The course itself should include teaching basics of Java in form of videos and assignments for practicing. The following resources and apps will be used:

 - [YouTube](http://youtube.com/) for hosting the teaching videos
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/) for hosting the code covered each video
 - [Java-N IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duy.compiler.javanide) for solving assignments on the smartphone

## The structure

The course should be structured in a way that also a student with zero knowledge about Java can start learning Java programming. It should also cover how to use Java-N IDE, that we will use for the practical part throughout the course. For showing the concepts of Java in the videos, also Java-N IDE should be used. So that in the explanation videos, the same tools are used as the viewer will use.
