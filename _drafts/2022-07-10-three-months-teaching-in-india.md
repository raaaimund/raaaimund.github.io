## What happened
### The college

Actually a lot happened during the last two months. Together with module 4 students, we could only finish about half of the course. After about one and a half month their time was totally occupied by working on their final year projects and learning for their last assignments. Since the final year project is very important for the last semester, they spent a lot time preparing for reviews and to finish their project in time. Nevertheless, we had really nice and interactive sessions together exploring software architecture and Git as well as GitHub. After graduation four students asked if they can continue working and finish the module anyways. But let's see how this develops.

Module 3 is also alread coming to an end, since the students also have to prepare for their final examinations. At least in this module we could cover all topics and assignments. I really enjoyed working with Module 3 students since they are asking a lot (really a lot) of questions and we spend a lot of time coding together. From teaching-block to teaching-block you can really observe their gained knowledge and progress. For example in the first teaching-block students often used only one Java class that contained all the code for the assignment. Now they are using multiple Java classes and methods to split their code into meaningful parts. They also think about using meaningful and understandable names for parts of the code.

The classes for Module 1 just started. Here we faced some challenges at the beginning. All computer labs were occupied for two weeks, since some examinations are going on. So we had to move to the computer lab of another building during this time. But due to the beginning of the rainy season, there are a lot of power breaks and the computers will get turned off four to five times during a class. Students brought their own laptops, but only 2 out of 16 students do have a laptop. Additionally, the internet connection is really, really, really slow so that students often have to use their personal mobile phone to access the internet with the systems at the computer lab. The problem is that many assignments of Module 1 rely on an internet connection. So a future task could be to change the assignments in a way that that they do not rely on internet that much or at least not all of the assignments.

Alltogether it is really nice to see
