## Open Space Technology

In an email [Paul](https://www.ict4d.at/about/){:target="_blank"} sent me after he attended the [World Summit on the Information Society](https://www.ict4d.at/2022/06/19/ict4d-at-at-the-world-summit-on-the-information-society-forum-2022-discussing-desc-and-acting-as-a-hltf/){:target="_blank"}, he mentioned the [InDIITA workshop](https://engagestandards.ieee.org/InDIITA2022.html){:target="_blank"} organized by [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/about/ieee-india.html/){:target="_blank"} in Bengaluru. InDIITA stands for __Dignity, Inclusion, Identity, Trust and Agency__. Since I am working near Bengaluru, I took the chance to attend the workshop. The location of the workshop was in the beautiful [Ramanujam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan){:target="_blank"} building within the [IIIT-B Campus](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. For setting the two days agenda, the [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology){:target="_blank"} concept was used, which was totally new to me and to be honest I could not imagine how such a workshop will be like. Before beginning each day, the agenda was dynamically set by the participants themself. Topics and talks were proposed and put into time slots that were spread throughout the day. Afterward, participants could freely move between sessions. I really liked the four principles

- Whoever comes are the right people
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
- Whenever it starts is the right time
- Whenever it's over, it's over

and the law of Open Space Technology

- The law of two feet/motion & responsibility - _If you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, respectfully get up and go somewhere that you will be!_



Overall, it was a really nice experience and I enjoyed the company of so many passionate people who want to use technology to improve peoples lives and help society for two days a lot. It really motivates me to continue finding solutions and exploring new things on how to include as much people as possible in the education of Software Development.
