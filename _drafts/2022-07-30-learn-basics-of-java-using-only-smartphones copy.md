## Inclusion and inequality

Education must include everyone. Of course, there are many challenges due to limited access to resources based on a low income or uneven distribution of wealth. The Key Indicators of Households Social Consumption on Education in India of the National Sample Survey ([NSS 75th round page 47](http://164.100.161.63/sites/default/files/publication_reports/KI_Education_75th_Final.pdf)) showed that in rural areas 4.4% and in urban areas 23.4% of the households are having a computer at home. The [Telecom Statistics of India 2019](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Telecom%20Statistics%20India-2019.pdf) on the other hand showed that the teledensity (telephones per 100 inhabitants) in rural areas is 57.50 and in urban areas is 159.66. [Deloitte's prediction for India is](https://www2.deloitte.com/in/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/big-bets-on-smartphones-semiconductors-and-streaming-service.html) that the number of smartphone users will increase in the coming years.

 So why not utilize smartphones for a software engineering course to include as many interested students as possible? Also, those students, who do not have access to a computer or laptop for their studies.

 ## Resources and apps
 
 In this post, I want to create a structure for a software engineering course that teaches the basics of Java programming with a strong focus that everything is solvable/doable using only smartphones to give students without a laptop a chance to learn computer programming. I have done such a course with some students in the past and important findings were
 
 - Small assignments, that teach concepts and include less code are solvable using only smartphones
 - Large assignments, like projects, that include more code and/or also .java files are hard to solve and time-consuming using only smartphones
 - The small screen size and virtual keyboard challenged the students the most
 - A Bluetooth keyboard helps a lot
 
 The course itself should include teaching basics of Java in form of videos and assignments for practicing. The following resources and apps will be used:

 - [YouTube](http://youtube.com/){:target="_blank"} for hosting the teaching videos
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} for hosting the assignments and also the code covered in each explanation video
 - [Java-N IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duy.compiler.javanide){:target="_blank"} ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/tranleduy2000/javaide){:target="_blank"}) for solving assignments on the smartphone
 - [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app){:target="_blank"} for using Git on the smartphone

## The structure

The course should be structured in a way that also a student with zero knowledge about Java can start learning Java programming. It should also cover how to use Java-N IDE, which we will use for the practical part throughout the course. The tool for showing the concepts of Java in the videos, Java-N IDE will be used. So that in the explanation videos, the same tool is used as the course participant will use.

The course should be split into three parts:

- The first part is about the basics of the Java programming language
- The second part is about the basics of object-oriented programming concepts
- The third part is about object-oriented programming concepts in more detail, a little bit about software architecture, and how to use Git

### The first part


### The second part


### The third part
