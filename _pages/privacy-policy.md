On this website I use two services which collect data

* Google Analytics for statistical purposes
* Disqus for comments

## Collected data

Google Analytics logs your IP Address but replaces the last 8 bits with 0. It also collects additional data and stores it for 26 months.

* Pages visited on this website
* Data about your browser
* Date and time of visits
* Refferer if available

## How I use your data

I use Google Analytics for basic insights how and why my blog is attracting visitors. Disqus is used in all blog posts if you want to leave a comment.
