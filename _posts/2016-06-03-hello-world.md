This is my [personal blog][1] using the [Carte Noire][2] theme for [Jekyll][3] from Jacob Tomlinson.

I am a programmer with a passion for web applications, cooking and everything regarding Microsoft.
With this Blog I'll try to share my daily issues and their solutions while programming, simple projects and also other stuff that comes in my mind.

Checkout our Youtube Channel [informatics.how][4] about serious algorithms explained the easy way.
