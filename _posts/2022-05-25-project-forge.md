        ### Enhancing the Resilience of Software Engineering Courses
        by Implementing Continuous Education using Smartphones exemplified by rural India
        ---
        ## Slides
        are available on [rittnauer.at](http://rittnauer.at)

        ## Background
        - I need a topic for my bachelor thesis
           - teaching SE at a rural college in India
        - ~50% of the students have no laptop/PC
        - COVID-19 school closures
        - Utilization of smartphones for the software engineering course
           - Continuous Education
           - We do not have to stop
        ---
        ## Remote teaching
        - One semester, two classes
        - Teaching material optimized for smartphones
        - All activities (learning, practicing, classes) can be done on smartphones
        - [Java N-IDEs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duy.compiler.javanide)
        - [Spck Code Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spck)
        - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
        - [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)
        - [Trinket](https://trinket.io/)
        ---
        ## Challenges
        - Screen size (even less when keyboard is shown)
        - Slow typing (especially with using special characters)
        - Small projects/assignments better than large projects
        - Mobile data/connection (~ 2GB per day)
        - Personal space for learning
        - Missing classes (personal/technical issues) -> provide recordings
        - Language -> provide recordings
        ---
        ## Current situation
        - Teaching two classes at the college
           - 3rd year students
           - 4th year students (final year)
        - Each class for three hours per week
        - No school closures
        ---
        ## Challenges
        - Availability of personal laptops
        - ~2GB of mobile data per day
        - Availability of internet at the college
           - not available
           - slow as hell
        - No internet available at the computer lab
           - before each class I have to ask the sysadmin to enable the internet
        ---
        ## Challenges
        - Students avoid the systems in the computer lab
           - there is no internet anyways
           - systems are really slow
        - Powercuts happen regularly
        ---
        > For today I used all my internet, so I am using the hotspot of a friend.
        ---
        ## Challenges
        - Final year students focus on their final year project
        - Spontaneous events make it difficult to conduct classes regularly
           - Festivities
           - Interviews
           - Placement trainings
           - Guest talks
           - Photo shootings
           - Final year project reviews
        ---
        > Honestly I could not spend a lot of time on RIT assignments this week. This was due to a lot of work load of my college's final year project and its deadline. I could only spend few hours on my RIT assignment works.
        ---
        > I am the project lead of the final year project and feel responsible for the implementation, so I could not spend a lot of time on the RIT assignments.
        ---
        ## Challenges
        - Everything is clear, no questions
        - Students submissions show the opposite
        ---
        ## Flipped classroom approach
        - Students do not prepare for the classes
           - (their) explanation: final year projects
        - Students liked the interactive session
           - one student types
           - one student moderates
           - rest of the students think how to implement
           - there were a lot of questions
           - but it took a long time
