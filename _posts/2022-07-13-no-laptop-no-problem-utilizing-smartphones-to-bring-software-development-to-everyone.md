        ## No laptop, no problem?
        Utilize smartphones to bring software development to "everyone"
        ---
        # Background
        ---
        ## Bachelor Thesis
        Enhancing the Resilience of Software Engineering Courses by Implementing Continuous Education using Smartphones Exemplified at a Rural College
        ---
        ## Resilience
        - school closures due to COVID-19 restrict access to computer lab at college
        - cannot attend class due to personal/technical problems
        - enhance location- and time-independency
        ---
        ## Continous Education
        - learning material is online available at any time
        - students can continue their journey even if semester is over

        Survey among students of 2nd and 3rd year (B-Tech)
        ---
        ## The course(s)
        - 2nd year - Java fundamentals (multiple small assignments)
        - 3rd year - Java OOP (project based)
        ---
        ## The plan
        - Set up was completely remotely
        - Learning platform - Moodle
        - Communication - Slack
        - Classes and submission reviews - Zoom
        - Practicing - Android apps & web services

        # The challenges
        ---
        ## Internet connection and power
        ---
        <img src="/assets/img/2022-07-13-utilize-smartphones-to-bring-software-development-to-everyone/daily-internet-data-limit.png">
        Survey among students of 3rd and 4th year (B-Tech)
        ---
        ## Internet connection and power
        - Limited mobile data per day while having remote classes all day long
        - Unstable internet connection or no mobile data
        - Power cuts
        - Even worse during rainy season
        ---
        > Due to slow internet connection, I could not attend the class.
        ---
        > Today, because of rain, I lost network, so I did not attend the class.
        ---
        > The net is all over, I tried to join, but it disconnects constantly Raimund.
        ---
        ## Reactions
        - Class recordings
        - Explanation videos of Java concepts
        - Android apps should also work offline
        ---
        ## Android apps
        - [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)
        - [Spck Code Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spck)
        - [Java N-IDE](https://github.com/shenghuntianlang/java-n-IDE-for-Android)
        - Most apps require internet connection, due to code compiling on remote servers
        ---
        > I prefer recordings, I can watch as often as I need.
        ---
        Submission reviews are also a challenge in a remote setup due to connection issues, and often background noises due to lack of a quiet learning environment.
        ---
        ## Placements > Skill development
        (my personal opinion)
        ---
        > Some selected students are at college now, due to placement trainings.
        ---
        > Your class is the only one where we have to do practical programming.
        ---
        > Fastly they complete the syllabus, but only theoretically.
        ---
        ## Programming on a Smartphone
        ---
        Students mentioned that they struggle with the small screen size and that the virtual keyboard covers most of the screen when active.
        ---
        > It is also hard to type and time-consuming compared to a laptop and/or computer.
        ---
        One student streamed the content of his smartphone to his TV and connected a bluetooth keyboard.
        ---
        > Laptop is more convenient for practical usage like programming and of course maybe because I am used to it.
        ---
        During the SSIs, 2nd year students mentioned that in their opinion, all assignments are solvable using a smartphone.
        ---
        During the SSIs, 3rd year students mentioned that in their opinion, the Java assignments are difficult to solve using a smartphone. They mentioned that smaller assignments which include less code would be easily solvable, but assignments that include more code and more (Java-) files are hard and timeconsuming to solve using a smartphone.
        ---
        Android apps often do not support the large feature set like on desktop IDEs (e.g. debugging, intellisense, ...).
        ---
        > On laptop we have more features to do the programming.
        ---
        ## Conclusion
        - Lack of physical keyboard and small screen size was mentioned the most
        - Students can participate using only Smartphones
           - Assignments must be designed appropriately
        - Only few Android apps that run entirely offline exist
        - Android apps are not as feature rich as desktop IDEs
        - Recording classes and providing learning material helps reach students
        ---
        ## 2022
        - Now I am in India
        - Created a new course for 4th year students
        - GitHub + Git on Termux + Java N-IDE
        - GitHub + Spck Code Editor (integrated Git client)
