## Free and open-source software (FOSS)

During my lunch break, right before my afternoon classes at the college, I randomly scrolled through [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rittnauer/){:target="_blank"} feed and sumbled across a post which mentioned that the [IndiaFOSS 2.0 event](https://indiafoss.net/){:target="_blank"} will be held on Saturday and Sunday this weekend. So I instantly wrote [Isabella and Paul](https://www.ict4d.at/about/){:target="_blank"} if it is okay to attend this event on behalf of [ICT4D.at](https://www.ict4d.at/){:target="_blank"}. On the same afternoon, I hold my class, rushed home, and right afterward jumped on the next bus to Bengaluru.

The conference was held in the beautiful [NIMHANS Convention Center in Bengaluru](https://goo.gl/maps/BHFmB6cVzHEuej5d9){:target="_blank"}. Breakfast, lunch, and tea was provided throughout the conference. Volunteers were my personal heroes of the conference. They really did an awesome job in making the weekend an unforgettable experience. The talks were also really great and each talk was totally interesting and inspiring. Again, sadly I could not split myself to attend all talks, because I had a really hard time to decide, which talk to attend next. Not to forget, I made really great connections during the conference and met many passionate people who love to build and solve not only technical but also social problems and use tech for good. It reminded me a lot of the participants at the [InDIITA workshop]({% post_url 2022-07-14-indiita-workshop %}){:target="_blank"}.

### Mon School

Since I am also teaching Software Engineering, it was really motivating to see others having the same goal. The passionate people from [mon.school](https://mon.school/){:target="_blank"} are also trying to bring joy in learning programming to everyone who is interested for free. They created their own CMS to focus on programming courses based on the [Frappe framework](https://frappe.io/){:target="_blank"} and currently are on the search for [content creators](https://mon.school/grants){:target="_blank"}.

### Rudra Saraswat

One of the most inspiring and interesting discussions I've ever listened was the session together with [Rudra Saraswat](https://about.ruds.io/){:target="_blank"}. He talked about his countless projects he is creating and contributing to, his passion about using Ubuntu and Arch Linux, and how he got interested in programming. Rudra describes himself as

> I'm a 12-year old n00b trying to
> - develop Ubuntu Unity, Ubuntu Web, UnityX, Gamebuntu, Una, UbuntuEd, Skull and Ubuntu Remixes
> - balance my usage of Arch and Ubuntu
> - stop ricing i3-gaps

What stick the most to my head was his answer to the question on how he learned all those things he need to do those things he is currently working on. I really cannot quote know the exact answer anymore, but the essence was that you do not essentially need to buy any expensive online or offline courses, get an university or college degree, or need guidance from a teacher to gather knowledge. Everything you need to know is available for free on the internet. You just have to know how to use Google, YouTube, boards, and to interact with the passionate community and people online. Many kudos to you and thanks a lot for that Rudra!

### Self-hosting with Nomad

Because I am also a huge fan of self-hosting and still always on the search to try new awesome technology, I attended the interesting talk held by [Karan Sharma](https://mrkaran.dev/){:target="_blank"} on how to use [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/){:target="_blank"} for self-hosting. If anyone is interested here are the [awesome slides](https://mrkaran.dev/talks/self-hosting-nomad-indiafoss.html#1){:target="_blank"} of his talk. I share the same opinion that it is a huge fun to experiment and test when doing self-hosting and that you really can benefit from those learnings.

### API and UI test automation with Karate

Never heard about [Karate](https://karatelabs.github.io/karate/){:target="_blank"} before, but it is definitely on my "to-try" list now. I just have to mention it here because it really sounds awesome and I did not know that such a tool with such a huge feature set actually exists.

[Karan M.V.](https://github.com/mvkaran){:target="_blank"} presented the actual stats like users, projects, contributions for 2022 on [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} in India. On [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} there is a [repository](https://github.com/github/india){:target="_blank"} where you can find resources and informations for the dev community in India. There is also [another collection](https://github.com/collections/made-in-india){:target="_blank"} of open-source projects built in or receiving significant contributions from India.

### Excalidraw

This was also an awesome, interesting, and insightful session held by [Akansha Doshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aa1992){:target="_blank"} about [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw){:target="_blank"} and how [they implemented end-to-end encryption](https://blog.excalidraw.com/end-to-end-encryption/){:target="_blank"}. [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/){:target="_blank"} is a virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams with end-to-end encryption. The [story of their product](https://blog.excalidraw.com/reflections-on-excalidraw/){:target="_blank"} and how the decision to make it open-source helped, was amazing and really inspiring.

### Tinkerhub movement among youth in Kerala

Another inspiring talk was held by [Moosa Meha MP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meharmp/){:target="_blank"} about [Tinkerhub](https://tinkerhub.org/){:target="_blank"}. It was really nice to hear that a [_bunch of technology loving students_](https://indiafoss.net/2022/cfp/submissions/tinkerhub-movement){:target="_blank"} are able to kick-off a whole movement (not only) across Kerala. Having other people that share the same passion and who empower, help, and guide you through the struggle on how to begin learning on how to program, and develop technical skills is a huge benefit and [Tinkerhub](https://tinkerhub.org/) can definitely assist you on that mission.
