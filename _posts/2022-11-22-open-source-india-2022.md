## Open Source India (OSI)

Similar to the [IndiaFOSS 2.0](https://fossunited.org/){:target="_blank"} event, I scrolled through my LinkedIn feed and stumbled across a post that mentioned that the [Open Source India 2022](https://www.opensourceindia.in/){:target="_blank"} conference will be held on the 29th and 30th of September 2022. Again, thankfully [ICT4D Austria](https://www.ict4d.at/){:target="_blank"} took over my expenses for traveling, staying, and visiting the event. I looked forward to a great and informative two-day event at [NIMHANS Convention Center in Bengaluru](https://goo.gl/maps/BHFmB6cVzHEuej5d9){:target="_blank"} with interesting and like-minded participants like the FOSS event and a great conference with interesting and state-of-the-art topics about Open-Source and networking within the community.

### Getting to the conference

This time, getting to the conference was quite an adventure. Firstly, I could not buy a ticket in advance, because no available payment provider was accepting foreign credit cards. Luckily the support was so friendly to assign a ticket to my account without paying anything in advance. I just had to pay directly at the conference location in cash. Sadly I missed the last bus the day before the conference in Bengaluru. So my new plan was to take an early bus in the morning at about 0500 AM. Somehow I forgot to plug in my phone, it went out of battery during the night and I missed the alarm. When I woke up, I rushed to the bus station and got the 1030 AM bus. Due to the very nice traffic in Bengaluru, we arrived very late at about 0300 to 0400 PM. I wanted to drop my luggage at the hotel and just go straight to the conference to pay for the ticket and maybe get a glimpse of the last sessions. As I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the booking of the room I did in advance could not be found and that they did not have any rooms available. So I had to find another hotel and sadly missed the whole first day of the conference.

### At the conference

Compared to the FOSS 2.0 event, there were much fewer students at the conference. I met many developers from the local developer scene in Bengaluru, and a few from other parts of India. Also, [MV Karan](https://github.com/mvkaran){:target="_blank"} gave another talk about the usage of GitHub in India with the title _Letâ€™s build from here, in India_. I am a huge fan of the [India GitHub repo](https://github.com/github/india){:target="_blank"} with various resources and information for the developer community in India. The other thing, that I like about those Open-Source conferences is the talks about the Open-Source journey of some product and/or developer team. It is interesting to see and hear the arguments for using Open-Source software in building a product or solution. Especially to hear about challenges or failures during development and how they got solved is fascinating and contains a lot of helpful information. Devtron's Open-Source Journey was an interesting talk. Especially because the importance of _failing fast_ gets highlighted in this talk.

Altogether it was a great conference with interesting and state-of-the-art topics about Open-Source. It was also a great opportunity to meet and do some networking with developers of the Open-Source community in Bengaluru and India. This time not only with the community but also with big players like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and others. I enjoy taking opportunities like those conferences to talk about ideas, projects, problems, and opinions. It generates new ideas, and solutions and opens new possibilities for my projects and ideas that I want to share and also develop further.
